# TriBridge — Discord ↔ Hypixel Guild Chat Bridge

A Node.js bot that relays messages between a Discord channel and a Hypixel guild chat in real time. Guild chat messages appear as embeds in Discord, and Discord messages are forwarded to the in-game guild chat. Join/leave notifications are relayed as well.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js** | v22 or newer |
| **npm** | Included with Node.js |
| **Discord Bot** | A bot application created at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the **Message Content** privileged intent enabled |
| **Minecraft Account** | A Microsoft account that owns Minecraft: Java Edition and can join `mc.hypixel.net` |

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Trilleo/TriBridge.git
   cd TriBridge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with the following variables:

   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_discord_channel_id
   MINECRAFT_USERNAME=your_minecraft_email
   ```

   | Variable | Description |
   |---|---|
   | `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Bot token from the Discord Developer Portal |
   | `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | ID of the Discord channel where messages will be relayed |
   | `MINECRAFT_USERNAME` | The email address of the Microsoft account used for Minecraft |

## Usage

**Start the bot:**

```bash
node src/index.js
```

On the first launch the bot will open a Microsoft authentication flow for the Minecraft account. Follow the instructions in the console to complete sign-in. Authentication tokens are cached in the `.minecraft-auth/` directory for subsequent runs.

### Discord Commands

| Command | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/invite <username>` | Management | Invite a player to the Hypixel guild (admin only) |
| `/kick <username> [reason]` | Management | Kick a member from the Hypixel guild (admin only) |
| `/promote <username>` | Management | Promote a member in the Hypixel guild (admin only) |
| `/demote <username>` | Management | Demote a member in the Hypixel guild (admin only) |
| `/send <message>` | Management | Send a command or message to the Minecraft server and display the response (admin only) |
| `/login` | Management | Connect the Minecraft bot to Hypixel |
| `/adminrole add/remove <role>` | Management | Configure the global admin roles for the bot (server admin only) |
| `/online` | Information | Show the currently online guild members |
| `/ping` | Information | Display Discord API latency and Minecraft connection status |
| `/help` | Information | Browse all available commands by category |

### How It Works

- **Discord → Minecraft** — Messages sent in the configured Discord channel are forwarded to the Hypixel guild chat (`/gc`).
- **Minecraft → Discord** — Guild chat messages, as well as member join/leave events, are relayed back to the Discord channel as rich embeds.
- **Auto-reconnect** — The bot automatically attempts to reconnect to Hypixel if the Minecraft connection drops.

## Updating

When new commits are pushed to the repository, pull the latest changes and reinstall dependencies:

```bash
git pull
npm install
```

Then restart the bot:

```bash
node src/index.js
```
